# GenUI Studio

Use text or image prompts to generate components and apps built with React.

## Get Started

### Get an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_KEY=sk-...
```

### Install

`yarn install`

### Start the app

`yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### How it works

1. User inputs a prompt with text and/or images.
2. A working React app is generated based on the prompt.
3. The user can ask for modifications or more features.
